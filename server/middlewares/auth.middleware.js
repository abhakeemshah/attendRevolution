// server/middlewares/auth.middleware.js

// The 'protect' and 'authorize' middleware functions in this file are obsolete.
// The old JWT-based authentication system for students and teachers with accounts
// has been removed.
//
// Teacher access is now controlled by 'teacherAuth.middleware.js'.
// Student-facing routes, like attendance marking, are now public.
//
// This file is left empty to avoid breaking any potential (though unlikely)
// lingering require() statements, but it provides no functionality.
